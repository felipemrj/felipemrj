# 👋 Hey! I’m Felipe

My journey is anything but ordinary, and that's exactly my greatest strength.  
From the world of web development to the precision driven universe of digital dentistry, I've learned that technology is most powerful when it transforms lives.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 Currently studying **Systems Analysis and Development** at **PUCPR**  
- 🛠️ Technical degree in **Web Development** (ETEC Pq. Belém)
- 🦷 3D technical designer in a dental prosthesis lab: modeling and printing customized dental solutions
- 💡 Bridging creativity, rigor, and empathy through multidisciplinary experience

After years combining code and 3D digital modeling, I’m now channeling all this passion back into tech.  
**My goal:** to build robust, scalable solutions as a backend developer, mastering Java and its entire ecosystem—with a solid grip on object-oriented programming and real-world problem-solving.
