# Hello!

My journey is anything but ordinary, and that's exactly my greatest strength.  
From the world of web development to the precision driven universe of digital dentistry, I've learned that technology is most powerful when it transforms lives.

## About Me

- Currently studying **Systems Analysis and Development** at **PUCPR**  
- Technical degree in **Web Development** (ETEC Pq. Belém)
- 3D technical designer in a dental prosthesis lab: modeling and printing customized dental solutions

After years of combined experience, I’m now channeling all this passion back into tech.  
**My goal:** build solutions as a backend developer, mastering Java and its entire ecosystem with a solid grip on object oriented programming and real world problem solving.
